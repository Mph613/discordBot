# discordBot
Nodejs backend connecting to the Discord API to manage Discord servers

# A config file & empty folders was removed
To make it work you will need to provide a .env.dahBot file inside the config file with two values
API_KEY=<Your KEY to your Discord Bot>
MONGODB_URL=<URL link to your mongoDB for the bot>

You will also need to add two folders within the root directory of the project (buttons & selects)
